# Scrimba Project - Blackjack

This is an application created during the [Learn JavaScript for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) course on Scrimba. 
Most of the application was taught how to code during the section, though I coded some extra features and added more spice to the Blackjack game app.
